# ML-Mini-Project
# 🌍 European Economic Indicators – Machine Learning Mini Project

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting key European economic indicators using regression models. It includes full data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a Flask web app for deployment.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training using multiple regression algorithms
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Deployment using Flask on a local or cloud server
